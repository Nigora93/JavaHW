Important notes:
* to print smth on the console we write a code in a 'sout';

2
* variables: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean;
* Data types to store floating point number/ decimal number:floating- 10.5, 2.3; 99% of the time we use decimal;
* in CHAR we can store: 'a', 'z', '-', '+', '1'(only one character at a time);
* boolean stores true or false;
*Variables rules: 1. first letter lowercase, but the rest upper: amIRight;
2. cant have the same variables twice;
3. in Java (caseSensetive) age and AGE is different;
* String can store multiple characters: "USA", "New York", "Hello World", "2964-72-5=76";

nextInt with int;
double: nextDouble();
boolean: nextBoolean();
char: no direct method/ next().charAt(0);//0 means we are interested in the first letter;
